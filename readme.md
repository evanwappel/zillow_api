This is a simple python file that should get you
up and running with the Zillow API and PyZillow

Documentation for PyZillow is here:
https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/pyzillow/latest/pyzillow.pdf

I know there is probably an easier way to expose the attributes
so if there are any suggestions, please feel free to
comment and/or send me a note.
